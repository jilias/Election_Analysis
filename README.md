# Election_Analysis
Module 3 - Python Poll
## Project Overview
The Colorado Board of Elections was seeking the election results and we're interested in the following:
- Total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

## Resources
Data Source: election_results.csv
Output: election_analysis.txt; election_results.txt
Software: Python 3.7.10, Visual Studio Code 1.56.2, Alteryx 2021.1.4.26400

## Summary Candidates
The analysis of the election show that:
-There were 369,711 votes cast in the election
-The candidates were:
      * Charles Casper Stockham
      * Diana DeGette
      * Raymon Anthony Doane
-The candidates results were:
      * Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes
      * Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes
      * Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes
- The winner of the election was:
      * Diana DeGette who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes
## Summary County
The analysis should show, but was not able to:
-There were 369,711 votes casted in the election
- There were three counties:
     * Arapahoe
     * Denver
     * Jefferson
- The counties turnout were as follows:
     * Arapahoe with 24,801 votes for turnout at 6.7%
     * Denver with 306,055 votes for turnout at 82.8%
     * Jefferson with 38,855 votes for turnout at 10.5%
- The county with the highest turnout would have been:
          * Denver with 306,055 votes and 82.8%
## Challenge Overview
Overall this posed a challenge mostly because I am not very familiar with python and continuaously getting the indentations correct in order to achieve a print output was incredibly frustrating. The F- strings are still a difficult concept to understand. However, it was overwhelmingly thrilling to see that everything aligned and the print outputs were coming through correctly from VS Studio through the terminal. Moreover it was satisfying being able to push the work through up to the repo.

**UPDATE** 
During the attempt to find the county with the highest turnout, the code did not go well. The first attempt, I had tried to use the template given the lesson, but to no avail, so I had gone ahead and used the one I had originally created and incorporate from there. At first, it seemed that Vizio/Terminal was able to read the parts however it did not return the correct counties or numbers. It was acknowledge "Arapahoe" as a county, but it was not ready vote counts or other items. I had decided to run the .csv file through Alteryx and create a small workflow to observe what the numbers should be and find all the counties within the dataset. While I was able to find the answer, I did not do so through python. I also manage to break the connection between git bash and my repository, Election_Analysis. I am continuing to attempt, but am unsure how to manage this currently. While not all the county code is correct, I feel that i was on the right track.

## Challenge Summary
In the end, python is difficult but definitely great coding once things start to click.

**UPDATE**
Python is alot more difficult than I originally perceived. While I am struggling, I am slowly understanding it and am trying to keep to pace.
