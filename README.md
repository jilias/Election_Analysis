# Election_Analysis
Module 3 - Python Poll
## Project Overview
The Colorado Board of Elections was seeking the election results and we're interested in the following:
- Total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

## Resources
Data Source: election_results.csv
Output: election_analysis.txt
Software: Python 3.7.10, Visual Studio Code 1.56.2

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
-There were 369,711 votes cast in the election
-The candidates were:
      * Charles Casper Stockham
      * Diana DeGette
      * Raymon Anthony Doane
-The candidates results were:
      * Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes
      * Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes
      * Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes
- The winner of the election was:
      * Diana DeGette who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes
## Challenge Overview
Overall this posed a challenge mostly because I am not very familiar with python and continuaously getting the indentations correct in order to achieve a print output was incredibly frustrating. The F- strings are still a difficult concept to understand. However, it was overwhelmingly thrilling to see that everything aligned and the print outputs were coming through correctly from VS Studio through the terminal. Moreover it was satisfying being able to push the work through up to the repo.

## Challenge Summary
In the end, python is difficult but definitely great coding once things start to click.
